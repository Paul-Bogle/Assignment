    <p class="report_text">When reading the assignment brief, I felt slightly intimidated as creating a website from scratch seemed difficult in my eyes. Personally, before this course I came from a computer networking background and within my previous course we didn’t do any programming or html and CSS at all. On the other hand, from the teaching we have received within the past 6 weeks I felt a lot more confident; learning isn’t supposed to be easy but there are ways to make it easier by ensuring that utilise all the tools you have access to such as online resources and even your classmates who may know a little bit more than you do about a certain topic. While working on the assignment I had collated with many students within my group along with the morning group as well as I had previously worked well with them in my first semester. After the teaching and all the information gathered, I felt individually confident to a level where I successfully setup my 5 pages and linked them together firstly as I thought that as much as it’s a simple task it’s one of the most important as it allows users to navigate to other pages within the webpage. After this was done, I gradually progressed my way through each task but of course I encountered some errors that could only be attended to and fixed with the help of some of my classmates that found more success with carrying out certain tasks such as creating forms as I struggled with that in class. Overall, from this experience I felt like I could now take these skills and then utilise them in order to go into industry, I used to be afraid of coding and think it’s too complex as its essentially speaking a different language but now that I have created this website, I feel like with at least another years’ experience I could take this web development skill to industry and succeed.</p>
