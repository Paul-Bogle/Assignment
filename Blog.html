    <p class="entry_one">The setup process involved creating the html and CSS files for the website along with ensuring that my work was accessible on git hub to ensure that I have a backup created just in case I had an issue where my work was to be lost. This was useful as unfortunately I had to re-install windows to my home system as when I was working on my assignment, my computer was blue screening. Before I had learned about the setup of git hub it seemed complex but as Iâ€™m a visual learner when demonstrated and then when I done it in a practical it was simplistic and took no time at all. Before creating the designs and content for each page, I had linked all the pages together to allow for a user to navigate to each of the 5 pages. This was an easy task but the most important as it could mean that if not correctly done things like this blog wouldnt be able to be seen at all.</p>
    <p class="entry_two">When creating a layout, I know I wanted to save a certain amount of time here somehow by ensuring that each page was the same in terms of overall layout; to do that I introduced a background image which took some time to research how to implement along with how to apply CSS to images as I had not done it before. After some research along with some assistance from some classmates, I was able to implement an image based on the file name along with resize the image to create a background that stayed within each screen. This would only save time as all it meant is the content on each page needed to be only altered a little bit to complete all the tasks the assignment brief requires me to do.</p>
    <p class="entry_three">As I briefly described in my site report, I had only encountered issues with adding forms in and linking them to open the email app. To overcome this, I had looked back at the lecture slides at it gave us a method that was showed to us in class on how to create the form along with submit and subject buttons. After doing this successfully and testing it multiple times I then moved on to creating the hand burger icon. The hand burger icon was one of the main things required for the phone layout to make the website robust and easy to navigate. Within the current times, people access the internet on their phone more than a computer as some people dont own systems but own mobile devices. This is an important tool for industry due to the increasing number of mobile users per year; along with this, technology is always improving and getting smaller and more portable, so websites are soon going to be mobile prioritized and then further developed for computers and other technology systems after.</p>
